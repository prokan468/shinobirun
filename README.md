## Inspiration
Initially when we started this hackathon, we just had a rough idea that we want a retro game. Further, we decided we want a game like 'Cadillacs and Dinosaurs'.

Now, us being Naruto anime fans, mixed both the world of retro gaming and Naruto and created our game 'Shinobi World'

## What it does
This game allows user to control Naruto which kills the incoming enemies with the Shuriken and Rasengan (allowing users to switch between them). There are 3 levels to this game where you kill all the enemies in each level and move forward to the next.

## How we built it
>We started with learning PyGame module and reading the documentations available. Each one of use made little mini projects to apply what we learnt.
>We started with building a level editor which gave us an interface to drag and drop the elements like how 'Scratch' works. 
>Then we built a basic game model with random characters to test our code and functions.
>Once, the testing was done, we focused on the graphics, where we worked on the background image, character image and enemy image.
>We tested the game a few times and it was ready to be uploaded.

## Challenges we ran into
>Initially, creating levels became a challenge for us. We were unaware of how to connect levels and how to proceed forward after one level. Then we saw something known as Level editor that can be made by integrating CSV and PyGame. So, with this our challenge was overcome.
>Graphics- Graphics came as a burden to all of us as we are from Computer Science background mainly focusing on backend. So, editing the image, properly aligning the image with the code so that it flips correctly when it flips, making it recursive so it looks a little realistic. We even spend hours deciding how to frame the Main Menu page! But, towards the end, it turned out fine.
>Large Data- After we implemented our graphics, we found our game choppy. It was due to Python having to fetch chunks of data in picture format. So, we had to change whatever data was changeable without any resulting errors.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
This is the first hackathon for our team. For some of us, it is even the First hackathon of our lives. So, seeing the first timers actually interested and contributing to the project was something we'd be proud of.
Also, we had only two people who were proficient in Python but the other two people put in all their efforts to learn Python and implement it in such a project. It is an accomplishment to us that we were able to learn a programming language so fast and implement it too.

## What we learned
Technically speaking, some of us got better in the already favorite Python language while some of us developed new affinity towards this language. We learned almost all the instructions of the Pygames and applied in this project.
If we talk about holistic developments, we all learned to synchronize with each other and help one another whenever we were in trouble. We understood the strengths and weaknesses of each and every person and what they are good in.
We plan to participate in more hackathons and these learnings will surely benefit us.

## What's next for Shinobi Run
We want to add more levels to it and give it a more retro look. This way people will be more satisfied with this game. After that, we can publish this game and the huge fanbase of Naruto is surely to be attracted to this game.
